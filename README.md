# Final Assignment v2

This repository contains the code for the "Final Assignment v2" project. The project involves analyzing and processing data related to Tesla's financial and stock performance using Python.

## Introduction
This project is part of a data analysis exercise, where we use Python libraries such as `pandas`, `yfinance`, and `requests` to extract and process financial data for Tesla. The data is then analyzed to gain insights into Tesla's revenue and stock performance over time.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and processing
- **pandas**: Library used for data manipulation and analysis
- **yfinance**: Library used to extract historical market data from Yahoo Finance
- **requests**: Library used for making HTTP requests
- **Jupyter Notebook**: IDE used for running and testing the code

- ## Code Overview
The notebook `Final Assignment-v2.ipynb` contains several key sections:

1. **Data Extraction**: 
   - Using `yfinance` to download Tesla stock data.
   - Using `requests` to scrape Tesla revenue data.

2. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Cleaning and formatting the revenue data by removing unwanted characters such as commas and dollar signs to prepare for analysis.

3. **Data Analysis**: 
   - Analyzing the trends in Tesla's stock price and revenue over time to identify patterns and insights.

4. **Visualization**: 
   - Using plots to visually represent Tesla's financial performance, making it easier to interpret trends and results.
